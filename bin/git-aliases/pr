  If no github pull request exists for this branch a draft github pull request
  will be created and then opened in the browser.  Otherwise, just open the
  github pull request in the browser.

  CREATING:
  For github pull request creation, the branch is assumed to follow the format
  of <username>/<JIRA-ISSUE>/<semantic-name>

  username      - is ignored

  JIRA-ISSUE    - is added to the title, and a link is created in a body to the
                  jira issue. 
                  
                  The title will be set in the following format:
                    [JIRA-ISSUE] <title>

                  The link will be placed in the body in the following format: 
                    [JIRA-ISSUE](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/JIRA-ISSUE

  semantic-name - Will be converted from kebab-case to Title Case and used in
                  the title of the github pull request.

  CLI Dependencies: git, gh, node, jira-cli
